# BMobIle
ARCore is an augmented reality development kit by Google for smartphones. One of its features is depth imaging which can determine the distance of objects/points in the environment from the phone's camera.
This study aims to explore the viability of depth images produced by ARCore applications in smartphones to estimate a personâ€™s BMI through height and weight estimation.

It uses two applications, one to estimate the height (ARMeasure), and another to estimate the weight and BMI of an individual (BMobIle)

# Requirements
A smartphone with ARCore Depth API support is required to run the applications. 
To see which devices are supported or not refer to the list here: https://developers.google.com/ar/devices

Additionally to build and install the applications on the phone, Android Studio is required.

More detailed instructions to setup and install the applications are found in setup.md
